# Simple-C-Dictionary
A simple greeklish to english and vice versa dictionary

#Current functionality:
1)Insert a greek word, and the english equivalent and save it onto a txt file(has to reside at the same directory as the executable) and keep track of the number of words that exist in the dictionary.
2)Edit a word that is already in the dictionary
3)Delete a word from the dictionary, and update the number of words that exist in the dictionary.
4)Translate a given word(from Greeklish to English and vice versa)
5)Translate a sentence(word-by-word) from Greeklish to English /*Working on the vice versa*/
6)Exit the dictionary and chose whether we want to save or not any changes that took place while the console application was running
